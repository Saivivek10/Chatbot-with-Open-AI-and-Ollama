# Chatbot-with-Open-AI-and-Ollama

This project contains two separate chatbot implementations using OpenAI and Ollama models. Both chatbots are built with Streamlit and LangChain, providing an interactive interface for users to ask questions and receive responses.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two folders:

1. **Ollama Chatbot**:
   - Uses the Ollama model for generating responses.
   - Includes a Streamlit-based user interface.
   - Allows users to adjust parameters like temperature and max tokens.

2. **Open AI Chatbot**:
   - Uses OpenAI's GPT models for generating responses.
   - Includes a Streamlit-based user interface.
   - Requires an OpenAI API key for operation.
   - Allows users to select the model and adjust parameters like temperature and max tokens.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Both chatbots provide a user-friendly interface for asking questions.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust response parameters such as temperature and max tokens.
- **Model Selection**: OpenAI chatbot allows selecting from multiple GPT models, while Ollama chatbot uses the "mistral" model.

## Requirements

Install the required dependencies for each chatbot by navigating to the respective folder and running:

```bash
